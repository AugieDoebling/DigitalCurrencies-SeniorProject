## Objective
Using social network data, news articles and search trends, we would like to model an optimal time to buy and sell digital currencies in short-term time periods. We believe the recent excitement around digital currencies gives their value a strong connection to public perception.

To do so, we will collect data using APIs about both the prevalence of conversation about digital currencies and the prices of digital currencies in those same cross-sections of time.  Using this, we could ideally find a way to predict the market behavior and develop a bot to buy and sell digital currencies in a more efficient way than humans could.  This would result in profits (or marginal gains) that could be measured in a small experiment.

## What's in This Repository
**Twitter** - Code used to call Twitter API to collect data. After initial collection, we have about 6 million rows. After its finalized, our plan is to publish this (and other public data we've collected to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

*More to come as project progesses*
